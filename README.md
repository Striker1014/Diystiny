# Diystiny

## Introduction

Since Destiny has blown up twitter with DIY discourse, I have noticed multiple chatters and people in the subreddit get carried away with it and spread very misinformed viewpoints on the matter. In addition I think that Destiny engaged in this topic in an irresponsible manner and in a way that is contrary to his values. By this I mean that he talks about matching energy but that is not what happened here whatsoever. So  first I would like to go over the original tweets that were sent and why I believe this to be the case, and then I will discuss some of the misinformation and harmful viewpoints that have propagated as a result. As a note, I know very little about testestorone therapy since it is not the hormone I want in my body, so I will not talk as much about it and will focus primarily on estrogen HRT.

## Setting the Stage

The current DIY issues started [with a tweet by Chloe](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416658439984488453) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/Jd2wMVs.png)) about something that [Mouthy Infidel said](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6j7C8EVcAElqLX?format=jpg&name=medium). The issue that was taken with Mouthy's tweet is that [you can get blood work](https://labsmd.com/) done without a doctor ordering it, the downside being that you would  have to pay out of pocket. Then she jokes about waiting years to get put on a low dose of premarin by the "medical gatekeeping system". Now on its own you could read into this as on the same level as anti-vaxxers or other anti-doctor/intellectual sentiment that has infested society during the Trump era; however in my perspective, "medical gatekeeping system" had nothing to do with not trusting doctors, but the [historical gatekeeping](https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&context=senproj_s2019) towards care that trans people have had to deal with for decades. This is the whole reason why the [Informed Consent](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_English.pdf) model for HRT has become more and more prevalent and the international standard for transgender healthcare.

The low dose premarin part is a reference to an outdated, much riskier form of estrogen that is not prescribed today as part of HRT. [Avi](https://twitter.com/AviBittMD/status/1416859420785528834) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/bn22mr7.png)) then enters the conversation to say as much in trying to make it seem like people DIY premarin, which IS NOT the case, the point of [Chloe mentioning premarin](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416658816926556161) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/vMn54Y6.png)) was that there are horror stories of doctors still using outdated guidelines or no guidelines whatsoever in relation to transitioning and HRT and prescribing low doses of estrogen and anti-androgens that don't provide enough feminization effects and/or riskier forms of estrogen than are primarily prescribed today for HRT. Following this, [Chloe tweets](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416659357257781251) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/186RbNK.png)) something close to Destiny's position on DIY, that it is a last resort because of failures in the medical system and a matter of harm reduction, because according to the [WPATH Standards of Care](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_English2012.pdf?_t=1613669341) "The consequences of abrupt withdrawal of hormones or lack of initiation of hormone therapy when
medically necessary include a high likelihood of negative outcomes such as surgical self-treatment
by autocastration, depressed mood, dysphoria, and/or suicidality [(Brown, 2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532731003688970)."

## The tweets

So now, the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416838533810069506) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/8LX1uGT.png)). Destiny then proceeded to discuss the topic in an appropriate manner and asked them to come on stream. Oh wait, that was [Glink](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1417263120955842580) ([image 1](https://i.imgur.com/4iM0OgO.png)) ([image 2](https://i.imgur.com/gVKVXOp.png)). The reason I consider his interaction here to be irresponsible is that there were multiple people that tried to engage with the topic: such as [Sorvia](https://twitter.com/QueenSorviaV/status/1416839595099054080) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/dGVs3px.png)), [Chloe](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416839702888390657) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/uSCPqp6.png)), and [Synth](https://twitter.com/synthishere/status/1416841626417238016) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/GNuK2vY.png)) but instead of engaging with it like he did with Glink, he [instead](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416843953983291392) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/fPQYo2H.png)) just [mocked](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416840945748770817) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/0gtj0Eq.png)) and [refused to engage](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416842926965985280) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/ie7TVod.png)). Imagine how useless it would be for him to have done and do the same for anti-vaxxers, it doesn't change anyones opinions or thought processes nor does it inform any audiences. It feels good in the moment to shit on the anti-intellectual conspiracy theorists, but at the end of the day the whole point is to learn more about a topic you weren't as knowledgeable in and to try to make a portion of the other person's audience think you had better arguments than they did and start to question "Why do I watch X and not Destiny if X has worse arguments on Y topic?" This is why I think that the way Destiny engaged with this topic was contrary to his values. People [continued](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416841292852568065) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/jyARAwT.png)) to [discuss](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416843514852171776) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/TnI0het.png)) the topic, but he didn't respond to reasonable conversation. He asked Glink to [come on stream](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1417262211106426880) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/BqIORcD.png)) on discuss the covid vaccine, however he never once did so during the DIY tweeting.

And then we have this [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416873280569372673) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/Rm3gaAx.png)). There has been a lot already said about it in chat, the subreddit, and the hundreds of quote tweets, so I will be brief. This tweet feels pretty shitty because its not like the "dipshit protesters that think they can torch buildings" where it is deliberately misconstrued by bad faith lefties to be "Destiny wants white supremacists to gun down black people", and this is not a 10 second clip chimp out of an hour long conversation. This is a deliberate tweet that he had plenty of time to word in this manner. I'm not going to waste time tone policing and say "oh you should've just said crazy deer people etc." but what I will say is that it feels really shitty to get lumped in with woke attack helicopter people just because I'm trans. It just feels shitty.

## Why are we still here?

Now this is the part that really bothered me, and I am anticipating people linking my own logs where frankly, I'm a piece of shit. I'm gonna work on being less toxic in chat and people can make of that what they want, I'm not going to waste time debating on it. There were numerous threads and convo's in DGG, and I don't want to sift through days of subreddit posts and dgg messages to not appear to be singling out chatters so I will not be showing examples except for one message in particular saying 'Most people's "self-diagnosis" is "I talked to a lot of trans people online and I'm totally like them"'. This conflates "diagnosing" yourself as trans with self-diagnosis of something like autism; this is the *one* time where self-diagnosis is actually correct because only you can tell yourself what your gender identity is. This also sounds very close to the conservative talking point that more and more people are becoming trans because of the online liberal environment transing them or that trans people are grooming people into becoming trans. 

When you are at the point where people take the position of "DIY hrt is sketchy but if its a matter of harm reduction then I guess its ok" and run it all the way to saying "people are self-diagnosing themselves as trans and *that is bad*" you have a serious issue with how you handled giving that take. In fact threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/oo1evv/literal_terf_dogwhistles_destiny_saying_chloe_is/) and Destiny himself talked about worrying of grooming concerns among DIYers. Now if there was evidence to point to that then sure, talking about it would make sense and be appropriate because that could be a nightmare scenario for conservatives to latch onto, however I have not seen any evidence of any of the people in these tweet chains encouraging anyone to DIY or to transition unprompted, just providing information about it to people that ask them.

### HRT doesn't fix your issues

One thing I saw said that really needs correcting is that HRT isn't a silver bullet that will solve your issues. Nobody thinks this. HRT is a tool to help with transitioning, not a magic pill that solves dysphoria. There are numerous studies that show that HRT does improve quality of life for trans people. Nobody views it as a silver bullet and I would love to see evidence to the contrary that anyone in those twitter threads views HRT as such. [This](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23574768/) shows that HRT has a positive effect in reducing stress levels, [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22145968/) shows that HRT has a positive effect of quality of life, [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470169/) shows a possitive effect of testosterone treatment on sexual function and mood for trans men, [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974216/) shows an association between adolescent puberty blocking and lower lifetime suicidality, and [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29331161/) showed lowered suicidal ideation and depression for trans veterans. No one claims that HRT prevents or fixes your dysphoria, it is a tool to help your transition as described by [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_English2012.pdf?_t=1613669341) and the treatment guidelines of the [Endocrine Society](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558). In the past, it was the guideline to have a ["real life experience/test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_experience_(transgender)) prior to starting HRT where you are required to live full-time as your affirmed gender for a period of time. This was recognized to be unreasonable for many patients as social transtion can be challenging if there is an incongruity between your affirmed gender and your physical appearance.

### Just go to a doctor

A common thing that was said was "go to a doctor don't act like you are able to synthesize multitudes of medical research on HRT yourself, doctors have as much schooling as they do for a reason". There are two problems with this, the first relates to access to medical care, and the second relates to doctor competence at trans healthcare. It is not the case that the only places with little or no access to HRT and medical care are [places like Russia or Brazil](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416843953983291392) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/fPQYo2H.png)). In my personal experience, I had it incredibly easy, I went to my universities health center and was able to start HRT within a month and a half of my first visit. This is not the case everywhere, I live in one of the most progressive states in the US, as well as one of the most progressive parts of that state in a college town at the time I started HRT. The common example that trans people will bring up is [the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/26/trans-patients-in-england-face-soul-destroying-wait-for-treatment) where it is common to have a waitlist for HRT of multiple years. And then it is a common occurrence to be told things like ["Are you sure you are trans? Why aren't you wearing makeup?"](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/trans-women-lipstick-healthcare-equality-b1846803.html) and then possibly be denied access to HRT and trans healthcare in general after that wait period. A multi year waitlist just to start your medical transition is abhorent to me, and it is the norm across much of Europe as well, such as in the [Netherlands](https://nltimes.nl/2020/02/20/many-transgenders-self-medicating-hormones-treatment-due-long-waiting-lists-report) and according to [Chloe about a dgger in Finland](https://twitter.com/bobposting/status/1416845467128717313) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/b8oYaYr.png)), as well as outside of Europe in [Alberta](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-transgender-medical-affect-awaiting-treatment.html). [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842950/) study lists numerous barriers to receiving gender-affirming care such as availability, lack of knowledge of doctors on transition-related care, and transphobia from providers.

### Doctor Competence

Now in terms of doctor competence we can see that even of prescribed patients, a [significant portion](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/893280) of US patients on spironolactone are not able to achieve desired testosterone suppression. In terms of knowledge on HRT, the meme right now is about [dermatologists](https://twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal/status/1416919701448318979) ([image](https://i.imgur.com/4TOa0w7.png)). The big thing that is brought up is endocrinologists, makes sense right? A doctor specializing in hormones would probably be the best bet to talk to about HRT, right? Well it turns out that from [this survey](https://www.endocrinepractice.org/article/S1530-891X\(20\)39209-0/fulltext) ([article](https://www.medpagetoday.com/endocrinology/generalendocrinology/56529) that isn't paywalled) that competence of endocrinology providers is not great. Only 63% of providers were willing to provide transgender care, with less than a third reporting seeing 5 or more patients in their career, 16% currently caring for at least 5 trans patients. Only half of providers had read the [Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558), but it was 70% for providers under 40. Only 41% described themselves as "somewhat" or "very" competent to provide transgender care. The most shocking part to me was that only 5% of respondents gave the correct answer to a competence question about estrogen therapy. More than two-thirds had received no transgender-related training during their fellowships. The study does have size limitations and generalization issues due to having been done at a "local meeting of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists in late 2015 in Maryland".

Another [study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/4/1286/2884622#64848062) showed that 80% of providers have treated a trans patient, but 80.6% have never received training on care of trans patients. Statistical results were that "Clinicians were very or somewhat confident in terms of definitions (77.1%), taking a history (63.3%), and prescribing hormones (64.8%); however, low confidence was reported outside of the hormonal realm." So even among specialists in hormones, only 65% are very or somewhat confident in prescribing hormones. It also seems, depending on what the definition of "transgender health clinical guidelines" is, that awareness of clinical guidelines is not as bad as the previous study said with 91.3% of respondents saying they are aware of them.

This final [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7417822/) has a lot of good insight into lack of teaching and clinical experiences with trans patients. I won't summarize its findings because I feel like I will do an injustice to it because it is a really great read on the failures of medical education on trans healthcare.

## Conclusion

My hope is that next time a similar discourse comes up that Destiny engages with it differently than he did this, because we can see that it's not that he isn't capable of engaging on twitter, he did so with Glink, and the consequences of not doing so is emboldening harmful beliefs by not addressing the issue in a responsible manner.
